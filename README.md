This project presents a comprehensive deep learning pipeline for the automated analysis of blood cell images, tackling two distinct but complementary tasks:

General Blood Component Detection: Identifying and localizing Red Blood Cells (RBC), White Blood Cells (WBC), and Platelets using various YOLOv8 architectures.

Leukemia Classification: Classifying lymphocytes into Benign or Malignant (Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia - ALL) subtypes using MobileNetV2, InceptionV3, and a custom-designed CNN named "MedNet".

The project emphasizes robust pre-processing, including an advanced nucleus segmentation pipeline, and a rigorous evaluation of different transfer learning and fine-tuning strategies to achieve state-of-the-art performance.

üåü Key Features

Dual-Stage Diagnostic Workflow: A complete pipeline from general cell detection to specific cancer classification.

Comparative Model Analysis:

Detection: Systematic evaluation of YOLOv8 variants (nano, small, medium, large, x-large) with different fine-tuning strategies.

Classification: In-depth comparison of MobileNetV2, InceptionV3, and a custom "MedNet" architecture.

Advanced Image Segmentation: A sophisticated pre-processing pipeline using CIELAB color space and K-Means clustering to isolate cell nuclei, significantly improving classification accuracy.

Rigorous Evaluation: Performance is assessed using a comprehensive suite of metrics including mAP, F1-Score, Accuracy, Precision, Recall, Dice Coefficient, and IoU.

High-Performance Results: The custom-built MedNet achieves 98.15% accuracy in cancer classification, while YOLOv8s provides an optimal balance of speed and accuracy for detection.

üöÄ Project Pipeline

The automated analysis workflow is structured in two key stages:

Stage 1: Object Detection (YOLOv8)

A blood smear image is fed into the trained YOLOv8 model.

The model detects and localizes all primary blood components: Red Blood Cells, White Blood Cells, and Platelets.

Figure: A sample image with ground-truth bounding box annotations for each object class.

Stage 2: Leukemia Classification (MedNet)

The bounding boxes corresponding to White Blood Cells are cropped.

These cropped images are passed to the high-performance MedNet classifier.

MedNet classifies each lymphocyte as Benign or one of the three Malignant subtypes (Early Pre-B, Pre-B, Pro-B).

üìä Models and Results
Task 1: Blood Cell Detection

Five variants of YOLOv8 were trained with three different unfreezing strategies (unfreezing all layers, last 10, and last 3). The YOLOv8s-all model provided the best balance of performance and efficiency.

Key Findings:

Best F1-Score: YOLOv8s-all (0.8906), making it the most balanced model for general detection.

Best mAP@0.5: YOLOv8m-all (0.9350), offering the highest raw detection quality.

Best Precision: YOLOv8x-last 10 (0.8841), ideal for minimizing false positives.

Fine-Tuning Strategy: Full fine-tuning (unfreezing all layers) consistently yielded the best performance across most model sizes.

Task 2: Leukemia Classification

Three models were trained on a specialized dataset for Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia. The training data underwent a sophisticated segmentation pre-processing step to isolate cell nuclei.

Key Findings:

The custom-designed, fine-tuned MedNet model significantly outperformed established pre-trained models.

The advanced segmentation pre-processing step played a crucial role in MedNet's success.

MedNet achieved a near-perfect test accuracy of 98.15%, solidifying its suitability for this critical diagnostic task.

Metric	MobileNetV2	InceptionV3	MedNet (fine-tuned)
Test Accuracy (%)	82.00%	92.92%	98.15%
F1-score (avg)	0.79	0.91	0.98
Precision (avg)	0.83	0.93	0.98
Recall (avg)	0.78	0.90	0.98
MAE	0.3108	0.1631	0.0554
False Negative Rate (avg)	0.1920	0.0972	0.0242

ÁµêË´ñ (Conclusion)

This study successfully demonstrates the power of a dual-stage deep learning pipeline for enhancing hematological diagnosis.

Task-Specific Solutions are Superior: For the high-stakes task of cancer classification, a custom-designed model (MedNet) with domain-specific pre-processing (nucleus segmentation) proved significantly more effective than general-purpose, pre-trained models.

Fine-Tuning Strategy is Paramount: The detection experiments revealed that the method of fine-tuning is as crucial as the choice of model architecture. Comprehensive fine-tuning consistently delivered superior performance.

Optimal Models for a Complete Workflow: The study identified two ideal models for a complete diagnostic workflow:

YOLOv8s-all: An excellent candidate for rapid, initial screening to detect and count all blood cells.

Fine-tuned MedNet: The definitive choice for the subsequent, critical step of classifying lymphocytes, offering unparalleled accuracy and reliability.
